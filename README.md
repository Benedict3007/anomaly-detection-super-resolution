# Industrial Anomaly Detection using Super-Resolution Models

Master's Thesis Project - Computer Science

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an innovative approach to industrial anomaly detection leveraging Super-Resolution (SR) models, specifically DRN-L and DRCT-L models, compared against the state-of-the-art EfficientAD model.

## 📊 Key Results

- Comprehensive evaluation on MVTec AD and GKD datasets
- Comparative analysis with EfficientAD (SOTA)
- Analysis of cascading approaches for SR models

## 🚧 Repository Under Construction

This repository is currently being restructured for public release. Full documentation and cleaned code coming soon!

## 📝 Citation

Thesis documentation and detailed results will be added shortly.
